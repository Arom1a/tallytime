# Contributing

## Documentation

1. Change directory to `docs` (i.e. `cd docs`).
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the dev server.

## PCB design

We use KiCad to design the PCB. Just submit a pull request with changes to the `/child` and `/main` directories to upload your contribution.
